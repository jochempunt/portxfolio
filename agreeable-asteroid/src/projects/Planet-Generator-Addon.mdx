# Planet-Generator
<Link href="https://github.com/jochempunt/PlanetenGenerator/" label="view project on Github" />

A Blender addon (Python, bpy) that procedurally generates customizable planets directly in the 3D viewport. Created for a university project, it supports Gas Giants and Terrestrial planets with fine-grained control over geometry, materials, atmosphere, rings, and render settings.

## Features
- Procedural planet generation (Gas Giant & Terrestrial)
- Customizable parameters: subdivision, continent division, noise/detail, color gradients, terrain bumpiness, ocean/wave settings, clouds, atmosphere opacity, ring size/thickness
- Full material node-tree generation (no external textures required)
