# Game Design Prototype: Temporal Transit Tales
A 3D adventure-mystery set in a deserted, steampunk-inspired train station where time has frozen. 
Players explore, use a time-control device to manipulate localized "time bubbles," and solve environmental puzzles to uncover the stationâ€™s hidden story.


## My Contributions

- Prototype development in Unity (C#): core interaction systems, scene scripting, puzzle logic
- Time mechanics: implemented deployable "time bubbles" that  allow the player to pause, rewind, or scroll through time.
- Spatial audio & sound integration: designed and integrated 3D/Spatial audio using Wwise for immersion and audio-driven clues
