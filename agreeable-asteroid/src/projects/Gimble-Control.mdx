# 3-Axis Gimbal Control Interface

As a research assistant, I developed control software for a motorized pan-tilt-roll camera gimbal driven by the PINE Controller from Blackforest Motion. The software supports research in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and 3D reconstruction by enabling precise camera movements.

## My Contributions

- **Designed a MATLAB GUI** to generate, preview, and export motion paths
(// img in sidebar)
- **Converted Euler angles to quaternions** for simpler user input and to prevent gimbal lock
- **Integrated SLERP** (Spherical Linear Interpolation) for smooth orientation transitions
- **Generated motion sequences** using the SLERP algorithm and converted them to a controller-readable format
